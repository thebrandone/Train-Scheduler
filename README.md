# Train-Scheduler

## Purpose 

The purpose of this application was to use a firebase database to store data and then use that data to calculate other numbers. This is important to know because you want to ensure the user submits as little information as possible to make it easier on them. With the minimal amount of data you can calcuate other necessary numbers (in this case we calculated the "Next Arrival" and "Minutes Away").

### Libraries Used

For this project I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [JQuery](https://code.jquery.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).

The Bootstrap was used for styling.

The JQuery was used for easily getting input values.

The Firebase was used to store submitted data.

The Moment.js was used to do the time calculations I described above already.
